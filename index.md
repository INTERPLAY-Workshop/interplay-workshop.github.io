Language models have grown increasingly powerful at performing complex tasks, motivating the study of their behavior as well as internals. However, these two objectives are often pursued in isolation and by distinct research communities. As a result, we lack robust and standardized interpretability methods to comprehensively assess LM behavior in complex, real-world scenarios. To address this gap, this workshop promotes research and discussion on the interplay between behavior and model internals. We aim to explore how understanding internal mechanisms can enhance our knowledge of complex model behaviors—and vice versa.
