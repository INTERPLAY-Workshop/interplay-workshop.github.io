Language models have grown increasingly powerful at performing complex tasks, motivating the study of their behavior and internals. However, distinct research communities often pursue these two objectives in isolation. As a result, we lack robust and standardized interpretability methods to assess LM behavior in complex, real-world scenarios comprehensively. This workshop promotes research and discussion on the interplay between behavior and model internals to address this gap. We aim to explore how understanding internal mechanisms can enhance our knowledge of complex model behaviors, and vice versa.
