# Call for Papers

We invite researchers working on either evaluating model behavior, internals, or both, to submit their work addressing (but not limited to) the following key questions:

- How can we jointly evaluate model behavior and internals?
- How do model interventions influence behavior, internals, and their interplay?
- How can we disentangle the influence of internal dynamics from external behavior?
- How do behavioral and internal evaluations align? Where and why do they differ?
- How do model size, architecture, and pre-training data influence the link between internals and behavior?


### Submission Format
Our workshop accepts submissions for three distinct tracks:

**1) Main Track**
- Empirical, methodological, or theoretical contributions
- Short papers: up to 4 pages (excl. references and appendices)
- Long papers: up to 9 pages (excl. references and appendices)

**2) Flash Track**
- Early ideas or preliminary results
- Up to 4 pages (excl. references and appendices)

**3) Lessons Learned Track**

We also invite researchers to present related and previously published work at this workshop. Reach out to us by email if you are interested.
