# Call for Papers

We invite researchers working on either evaluating model behavior, internals, or both, to submit their work addressing (but not limited to) the following key questions:

- How can we jointly evaluate model behavior and internals?
- How do model interventions influence behavior, internals, and their interplay?
- How can we disentangle the influence of internal dynamics from external behavior?
- How do behavioral and internal evaluations align? Where and why do they differ?
- How do model size, architecture, and pre-training data influence the link between internals and behavior?

We are looking for reviewers, please register [here](https://interplay-workshop.limesurvey.net/615291?lang=en).

### Submission Format
Our workshop accepts archival (OpenReview) and non-archival (published or unpublished) submissions for three distinct tracks:

**1) Main Track**
- Empirical, methodological, or theoretical contributions
- Short papers: up to 4 pages (excl. references and appendices)
- Long papers: up to 9 pages (excl. references and appendices)

**2) Flash Track**
- Early ideas or preliminary results
- Up to 4 pages (excl. references and appendices)

**3) Lessons Learned Track**
- Insights from negative or inconclusive experiments
- Up to 4 pages (excl. references and appendices)

We also invite researchers to present related and previously published work at this workshop. If you are interested, [email us](interplay.workshop@proton.me).

### ðŸš¨Pre-Reviewed SubmissionsðŸš¨
Researchers are welcome to submit papers that have undergone a review process at other venues, such as ARR or COLM, particularly in cases of prior rejections.

If you choose to submit such a paper, you must include the complete reviews, encompassing both the text and scores, from the original review process in your submission's appendix. 
Any meta-reviews that were provided should also be included if available.

Furthermore, you have the option to include a one-page response letter within the appendix. This letter provides an opportunity to address the (meta-)reviews and elaborate on how you may have revised your paper in response to the feedback received.
Pre-Reviewed submissions will be managed via a separate [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=colmweb.org/COLM/2025/Workshop/INTERPLAY_Pre_Reviewed#tab-your-consoles) event. 

### Presentation Format
Submissions of all tracks will be presented as posters at the workshop. We will also invite selected submissions for a short talk (5-15 minutes). Please note: At least one author must attend the workshop in person for talks.
